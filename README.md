# GA_unfused_NFAs
Genetic algorithm to discover unfused non-fullerene acceptors

Jupyter notebooks, python scripts, and raw data for the "Computational Evolution of High-Performing Unfused Non-Fullerene Acceptors for Organic Solar Cells" article (TBD).

The repository includes scripts for the genetic algorithms, as well as scripts for the generation of the figures used.
